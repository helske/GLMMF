# GLMMF
Generalized Linear Mixed Models with Latent Factors

GLMMF is an experimental R package for fitting generalized linear mixed models with latent factors using state space modelling approach.

Similar and broader functionality is available in [KFAS](https://github.com/helske/KFAS), but this has probably somewhat easier interface due to more limited scope. Compared to KFAS, main functions in GLMFF is written in C++.

Package is currently not actively developed and contains some untested parts and most likely bugs.
